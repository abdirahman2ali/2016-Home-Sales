# Home-Sales
This repo contains the mapping of home sales in the city of Toronto. The dataset was used from Kaggle. The dataset includes the listing prices for the sale of properties (mostly houses) in Ontario.
They are obtained for a short period of time in July 2016 and include the following fields:

Price in dollars
Address of the property
Latitude and Longitude of the address obtained by using Google Geocoding service
Area Name of the property obtained by using Google Geocoding service

I wanted to plot all the points over a map of Toronto, and make some interactive visualization.
